# Draft – 22.4.2025

### [Slide 1]  
**Hi, I’m Natalie.**  

The end. Right? That’s it. Short. Snappy. Iconic. Just like me.

...But okay, I’ll elaborate – just for you.

---

### [Slide 2]  
You probably know me as a student. Maybe a classmate. Some of you know me better. Some of you still confuse me with that other Natalie from our grade. (It’s okay – you wouldn’t be the first, and honestly, I’m used to it.)

Either way, today I’ve been handed a rare gift: seven uninterrupted minutes to talk exclusively about myself. And yes, I plan to use every second. 
So welcome to my TED-ish talk.


---

### [Slide 3]  
So – who am I?

Honestly? I couldn’t tell you. And I’m not trying to be deep here – that’s just neuroscience.

But depending on the time of day and who I’m talking to, I shapeshift. The person standing here right now is not the same person my dog sees when I walk in the door. That version? Fully unhinged.

---

### [Slide 4]  
Here’s a rough list, just to get us started:  I’m a student. A CEO. A graphic designer. A business developer. A strategist.  A dog parent. A digital nomad. A pro-level online shopper. A semi-retired golfer.  A book collector. A Netflix critic. A part-time seamstress. A gym regular. A Cancer sun and a Dragon by lunar reckoning – and according to my horoscope, I’m bringing wealth this year. Just saying.

Also? I know how to change a tire. Because… life.

Some days, I’m all of those things. Some days, I’m none. But every day, I’m still very, very me.


---

### [Slide 5]  
I’m here today to tell you a story.

But full disclosure: when I sat down to write my speech, I got overwhelmed.
 Because in my head, whatever I say today better be good enough to make someone on an Ivy League admissions board cry – ideally in the first two minutes.

Then I reminded myself: I’m not here to be exceptional. I’m here to be real.


---

### [Slide 6]  
Truth is, I’m pretty ordinary.  
Ordinary – with **a wildly disproportionate amount of ambition**.  

And like most ambitious people, I often live in that delightful brain-loop of:  
“I’m not good enough for this.”  

Even though I may be doing *this*... right now.

---

### [Slide 7]  
So how do I get past that?

Sometimes I just ask myself: “If someone else had my exact CV, would I think they’re qualified?” Usually, the answer is yes. So… why not me?

Either way, I shoot my shot. Because really—what’s the worst that could happen? A polite “no”?
 Been there. Survived it. Sometimes had a mild breakdown.  But I bounced back – and kept moving.

---

### [Slide 8]  
Three years ago, I decided I wanted to start my own creative agency. Great vision – except I had the business mindset, but zero design experience.

So... I came here. I studied. I learned. I received praise and recognition for my work.  But to be honest? I wasn’t entirely sold on the quality of education.
So I went out and got extra qualifications from UAL in London.

Not because I had to – but because I thrive on pressure and structure. Academia keeps me accountable. It doesn’t wait for motivation – it runs on momentum. And if you stop showing up, it doesn’t slow down for you.

---

### [Slide 9]  
Fast forward to now: I run a start-up that’s doing well (fingers crossed, touch wood, burn some sage – whatever works.) I’m currently in the process of hiring full-time employees – which is a whole saga of its own. 
I’ve worked across design, business development and marketing. I’ve built brands and I’ve built systems. Even organised events. 

But here’s the thing: I don’t get comfortable. Because the moment you do, the market moves on – without you.


---

### [Slide 10]  
This brings me to my family's unofficial motto:  

**“There’s no such thing as luck.”**  
There’s preparation.  
There’s persistence.  
And then there’s timing.

I believe 90% of “luck” is just being ready when the door cracks open.

---

### [Slide 11]  
So yes, I have degrees lined up like ducks. 
I’ve got experience, extra certifications, clients, even a cute pro-bono side project...

But none of that means I stop saying yes to growth. The title doesn’t matter – the learning does.

---

### [Slide 12]  
I believe in **stacking experiences.**  Big or small. Paid or unpaid. Every step builds something. And that something makes you better. It makes you an asset.
But I also believe in protecting your energy. Not every client is the right client.  Not every “opportunity” deserves a yes. And some projects? If they’re draining your will to live – be sure to charge hourly.

---

### [Slide 13]  
My point?

I’m not telling you to say yes to everything.  
I’m telling you to say yes to the *right* things.  
To things that challenge you. That teach you.  
To things that terrify you just a little.

---

### [Slide 14]  
So here’s what you get with me:

Someone ordinary. Because who does **extraordinary things on Tuesday afternoons?**. 

Someone who’s always learning – even when it means starting at the bottom again. Someone who thinks creatively, acts strategically, and genuinely *cares* about the work.

---

### [Slide 15]  
And if you’re still wondering, “Why should I hire her?”

Well... if nothing else, I put together a mean storytelling talk.

Thank you.
