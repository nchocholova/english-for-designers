# Draft – 22.4.2025

### Hi, I’m Natalie
 
The end. Right? That’s it. Short. Snappy. Iconic. Just like me.

...But okay, I’ll elaborate – just for you.

---

### The Headliner: Me, Myself, and I
You probably know me as a student. Maybe a classmate. Some of you know me better. Some of you still confuse me with that other Natalie from our grade. (It’s okay – you wouldn’t be the first, and honestly, I’m used to it.)

Either way, today I’ve been handed a rare gift: seven uninterrupted minutes to talk exclusively about myself. And yes, I plan to use every second. 
So welcome to my TED-ish talk.


---

### So – who am I?  

Honestly? I couldn’t tell you. And I’m not trying to be deep here – that’s just neuroscience.

But depending on the time of day and who I’m talking to, I shapeshift. The person standing here right now is not the same person my dog sees when I walk in the door. That version? Fully unhinged.

---

### Who Says You Can’t Be Everything?  
Here’s a rough list, just to get us started:  I’m a student. A CEO. A graphic designer. A business developer. A strategist.  A dog parent. A digital nomad. A pro-level online shopper. A semi-retired golfer.  A book collector. A Netflix critic. A part-time seamstress. A gym regular. A Cancer sun and a Dragon by lunar reckoning – and according to my horoscope, I’m bringing wealth this year. Just saying.

Also? I know how to change a tire. Because… life.

Some days, I’m all of those things. Some days, I’m none. But every day, I’m still very, very me.


---

### This Better Be Ivy League-Worthy (It’s Really Not)  
I’m here today to tell you a story.

But full disclosure: when I sat down to write my speech, I got overwhelmed.
 Because in my head, whatever I say today better be good enough to make someone on an Ivy League admissions board cry – ideally in the first two minutes.

Then I reminded myself: I’m not here to be exceptional. I’m here to be real.


---

### Ordinary Person, Unreasonable Standards  
Truth is, I’m pretty ordinary.  
Ordinary – with **a wildly disproportionate amount of ambition**.  

And like most ambitious people, I often live in that delightful brain-loop of:  
“I’m not good enough for this.”  

Even though I may be doing *this*... right now.

---

### Mentally Spiraling in a Professional Way  
So how do I get past that?

Sometimes I just ask myself: “If someone else had my exact CV, would I think they’re qualified?” Usually, the answer is yes. So… why not me?

Either way, I shoot my shot. Because really—what’s the worst that could happen? A polite “no”?
 Been there. Survived it. Sometimes had a mild breakdown.  But I bounced back – and kept moving.

---

### Ambition Meets Reality  
Three years ago, I decided I wanted to start my own creative agency. Great vision – except I had the business mindset, but zero design experience.

So... I came here. I studied. I learned. I received praise and recognition for my work.  But to be honest? I wasn’t entirely sold on the quality of education.
So I went out and got extra qualifications from UAL in London.

Not because I had to – but because I thrive on pressure and structure. Academia keeps me accountable. It doesn’t wait for motivation – it runs on momentum. And if you stop showing up, it doesn’t slow down for you.

---

### The Market Doesn’t Wait. Neither Do I.  
Fast forward to now: I run a start-up that’s doing well (fingers crossed, touch wood, burn some sage – whatever works.) I’m currently in the process of hiring full-time employees – which is a whole saga of its own. 
I’ve worked across design, business development and marketing. I’ve built brands and I’ve built systems. Even organised events. 

But here’s the thing: I don’t get comfortable. Because the moment you do, the market moves on – without you.


---

### Luck Is a Myth. Deal With It. 
This brings me to my family's unofficial motto:  

**“There’s no such thing as luck.”**  
There’s preparation.  
There’s persistence.  
And then there’s timing.

I believe 90% of “luck” is just being ready when the door cracks open.

---

### Adapt or Get Left Behind
Here’s the thing: I used to be scared of AI.

Not because I thought the robots were taking over – but because I couldn’t quite grasp what it meant for the future of work. I first came face-to-face with the possibilities of AI a few years ago at a legal marketing conference. There, I saw AI being used to generate content, write social media posts, streamline workflows — and my first thought? “This is sick!.” My second? “This makes me sick.”

As someone building a creative agency, I already knew how hard it would be to find people who could think critically, write well, and stay original. The idea that anyone could now look smart on paper thanks to AI — without actually being smart in real life? Terrifying.

---

### But I Didn't Panic. I Pivoted
I started learning. Deep-dived into machine learning. Taught myself the basics of how these systems actually work. 

And what I discovered was surprising: AI isn’t magic. It’s labor-intensive, messy, and still needs a human brain to direct it. In other words — it’s not here to replace us. It’s here to amplify us.

---

### Now? AI is my Productivity Partner
It’s the rubber duck that helps me problem-solve.
It’s the assistant that expands my image canvas without a meltdown.
It’s the tool that helps me do more, faster — without doing less, dumber.

---

### But There's a Catch
But here’s the catch: you can’t just learn about AI and stay exactly where you are. You’ve got to move with it. Apply it. Experiment with it. Keep your human skills sharp — because capitalism is capitalism, and what’s free today might be premium tomorrow.

So yes, I use AI. But I still know how to do it myself.
That’s the difference between getting ahead — and getting left behind.

---

### One Way Ticket to the Elderly Home
Forget the grandma mindset. You can’t say “no” to progress and expect the world to wait for you. It won’t. You either adapt, or you become irrelevant.

---

### Qualified, But Still Curious  
So yes, I have degrees lined up like ducks in a row. 
I’ve got experience, extra certifications, clients, even a cute pro-bono side project...

But none of that means I stop saying yes to growth. The title doesn’t matter – the learning does.

---

### Growth Is Good. Boundaries Are Better.  
I believe in **stacking experiences.**  Big or small. Paid or unpaid. Every step builds something.  And that something makes you better. It makes you an asset.
But I also believe in protecting your energy.  Not every client is the right client.  Not every “opportunity” deserves a yes. And some projects?  If they’re draining your will to live – be sure to charge hourly.

---

### My point?  

I’m not telling you to say yes to everything.  
I’m telling you to say yes to the *right* things.  
To things that challenge you. That teach you.  
To things that terrify you just a little.

---

### I'd Hire Me Before Someone Else Does  
So here’s what you get with me:

Someone ordinary. Because who does **extraordinary things on Tuesday afternoons?**. 

Someone who’s always learning – even when it means starting at the bottom again. Someone who thinks creatively, acts strategically, and genuinely *cares* about the work.

---

### Now Accepting Compliments (and Contracts)  
And if you’re still wondering, “Why should I hire her?”

Well... if nothing else, I put together a mean storytelling talk.

Thank you.
