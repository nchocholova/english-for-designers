#### Nap Mapper
*2024, Product Design, Motion*

What happens when you mix sleep-deprived design students with a mobile app assignment? You get Nap Mapper – my solution for finding the perfect urban recharge spots in Prague’s bustling center.

When Martin Strnad from HMS Design challenged us to create mobile apps, I decided to dodge the predictable finance apps and take a more non-conventional approach: helping professionals and students discover their perfect mid-day power nap spots.

Below is a preview of the project. The Figma prototype is then available [HERE](https://www.figma.com/proto/VSVkqaB53q1ffSdXW7h4rP/Napper-Mapper?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=0-300&node-type=canvas&viewport=665%2C343%2C0.23&t=0I2By8edgqKl7rRn-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=0%3A300)

While this started as a team project with Eliška Fantová, Valerie Virtová, and Alicie Weinfurtová, we each ended up crafting our own unique app (because why stop at one when you can have four?).

#### Café Letka
*2024, Visual Identity, Typography*

Ever wondered what happens when aviation meets typography? For Café Letka, we turned airplane trails into letterforms, crafting a visual identity that’s as bold as it is meaningful.

Working with contrails as inspiration, we stripped away the literal airplane references while keeping the essence of flight. The result? A dynamic typographic system that dances across applications, powered by the clean lines of Atyp BL in confident uppercase.

I collaborated on this project with Natálie Ďurinská, Eliška Fantová, Valerie Virtová, and Alicie Weinfurtová. All visualisations, including the logo, are my personal contributions to the project.

#### Pitfall of AI?
*2024, Social Impact, Digital Design*

With 86% of students now using AI for academic work, a crucial question emerges: Are we enhancing our minds or outsourcing our thinking? Through this political poster, I explore artificial intelligence’s dual nature – a tool promising advancement while potentially harming our ability to think independently.
