**About Me (tailored to an academic setting):**

Something about me? Sure, but I’ll keep it brief.
My name is Natálie Chocholová, and I have a strong background in international business and management. After gaining some experience, I realized that traditional consulting wasn’t quite the right fit for me. While I didn’t dislike it, climbing the corporate ladder didn’t provide the fulfillment I was seeking, and I found myself missing a creative element in my work. The best advice (or so everyone says) is to combine your career with your passions, which led me to pursue brand consulting. Nevertheless, I also believe that offering graphic design services requires a solid educational foundation in the field.
That’s why I’m currently in the final year of my bachelor’s program at PSCC and running my own business. When things quiet down, I enjoy taking short courses to keep challenging myself. I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and improve – some might say I have a bit of a complex? But I believe that pursuing a master’s degree will be a fantastic opportunity to refine my skills, learn new techniques, and receive valuable feedback from top industry professionals.
