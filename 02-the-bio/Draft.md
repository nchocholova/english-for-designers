**About Me (tailored to an academic setting 18.11):**

Something about me? Sure, but I’ll keep it brief.

My name is Natálie Chocholová, and I have a strong background in international business and management. After gaining some experience, I realized that traditional consulting wasn’t quite the right fit for me. While I didn’t dislike it, climbing the corporate ladder didn’t provide the fulfillment I was seeking, and I found myself missing a creative element in my work. The best advice (or so everyone says) is to combine your career with your passions, which led me to pursue brand consulting. Nevertheless, I also believe that offering graphic design services requires a solid educational foundation in the field.

~~That’s why I’m currently in the final year of my bachelor’s program at PSCC and running my own business. When things quiet down, I enjoy taking short courses to keep challenging myself. I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and improve – some might say I have a bit of a complex? But I believe that pursuing a master’s degree will be a fantastic opportunity to refine my skills, learn new techniques, and receive valuable feedback from top industry professionals.~~


**About Me (edited 26.11)**

Hi, I’m Natálie Chocholová – a consultant-designer hybrid with a knack for transforming brands into their best versions. My journey started in international business and management, where I built a solid foundation in strategy and problem-solving. But I quickly realised something was missing: creativity.

That’s when I pivoted. Merging my business know-how with a passion for design, I dove into brand consulting and launched my own business. Now, I help brands stand out and connect, blending strategic thinking with creative flair.

Curious? Let’s create something extraordinary together!
