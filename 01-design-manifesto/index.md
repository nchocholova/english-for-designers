# Design Manifesto

- **Say NO to Half-Baked Ideas:** Our clients invest more than just time—they trust us with their future success. In return, any concept we present must be thought-out and backed by rationale. Half-baked ideas are reserved for internal brainstorming only. Gut feelings are not enough; every decision needs to be supported by evidence and strategy.

- **Say It Like It Is:** Our goal is to get you from point A to B in the most effective manner. If we seem a little direct, it’s because we prioritise results over pleasantries. We're here to find the perfect solution using the most efficient route—not to make unnecessary detours just to ‘milk’ the hourly rate.

- **B2You:** Business jargon is filled with abbreviations (B2B, B2C, C2B…). But for us, it all comes down to one thing: _you_. Regardless of your business model, we’ll work to find a solution that fits.

- **Quality Comes at a Price:** Top-tier services come with a price tag. Our pricing is flexible and scales with the scope of the project, but if you think your relative can reach the same output, we won’t stop you. Excellence demands investment.

- **Who’s the Designer in This Relationship?:** We’re here to bring your vision to life, and that means revisions, feedback, and transparency are part of the process. But we’re not here to be micromanaged or second-guessed at every turn. Mutual respect and trust in our expertise are essential. If you feel someone else can do it better, we’ll happily step aside and let you take the reins.
