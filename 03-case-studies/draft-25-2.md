### The Challenge: Modernising an Aviation-Inspired Brand
Café Letka faced a unique challenge. Located near Prague's military aviation museum, the café had organically developed 
an aviation theme, initially expressed through the owner's daughter's hand-drawn airplane illustrations. 
While this connection to local heritage gave the café character, several factors demanded a more sophisticated approach:

- The growing popularity on social media was attracting tourists, requiring a more polished and comprehensive brand identity
- A neighbouring café with similar aviation themes created confusion and competitive pressure
- The conjoined theater space (Club Letka) needed visual cohesion with the café, despite serving different purposes
- The existing visual identity lacked the flexibility needed for a growing business

### The Design Approach: Elevating Through Typography
#### Research & Discovery
Our process began with immersive research, spending time in both Café Letka and Club Letka to understand:

- The atmospheric qualities that made the space unique
- How customers moved through and interacted with both venues
- The existing visual touch-points and their effectiveness
- The unique position of being both a local favourite and tourist destination

#### Conceptual Development
We extracted the essence of aviation—movement, contrails, and flight paths—while avoiding the obvious airplane illustrations. 
This abstract approach allowed us to:

- Create a distinctive visual language that competitors couldn't easily replicate
- Develop a system based on typography rather than illustrations
- Build a flexible identity system that could work across both café and theater applications

#### Typography as the Hero
The selection of Atyp BL in confident uppercase became our foundation, chosen specifically because:

- It offered distinctive character while maintaining legibility when used unconventionally
- Its clean lines complemented the contrail concept without competing visually
- The letterforms could sustain manipulation along flight paths while remaining recognisable

### The Solution: A Dynamic Typographic System
Our solution transformed airplane contrails into a typographic experience:

- Letters follow the dynamic, unexpected patterns of flight paths
- The visual system maintains cohesion while allowing for playful variation
- Applications range from static (signage, packaging) to dynamic (menus, takeaway materials)

#### Brand Applications
We created a comprehensive suite of touch-points:

- Primary and secondary logos for different applications
- Packaging systems for food and beverage items
- Custom takeaway carriers that showcase the identity
- Cup designs that turn everyday items into brand expressions
- Menus that leverage the dynamic typography system

### Outcomes and Reflections
While the client ultimately chose a simpler, logo-centric approach, this project yielded valuable insights:

#### Team Collaboration Under Constraint
The project presented unique collaboration challenges, with team members working across different countries. This required:

- Rigorous communication protocols
- Strategic use of virtual collaboration tools
- Disciplined documentation of decisions and progress

#### Design Learnings
The most valuable takeaways from this project include:

- Finding the balance between distinctive design and practical application
- Creating systems that can flex across different contexts while maintaining coherence
- Developing typography-forward solutions that don't rely on illustrative elements
- Building identities that have both immediate impact and long-term flexibility
