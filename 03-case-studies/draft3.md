### ~~Aviation Heritage Meets Modern Visual Identity~~ 
### A Hand-Drawn Plane That Couldn't Fly Forever

~~Coffee is always a great partner in crime, so unsurprisingly, I was excited to make my way to Café Letka, nestled near Prague’s military aviation museum. Above their entrance hangs the café’s logo: a charming hand-drawn aeroplane crafted by the owner’s daughter. While endearing, this simple emblem faced mounting challenges.~~

~~“We’re becoming quite a destination,” the owner explained during our first meeting. Social media had thrust Café Letka into the spotlight, attracting both locals and tourists. Meanwhile, a competitor just a block away leveraged similar aviation themes, creating market confusion.~~

Coffee is always a faithful sidekick – so when a café project lands on your desk, you know it’s going to be a good one. Café Letka sits near Prague’s military aviation museum, and above its entrance hangs a charming logo: a hand-drawn aeroplane created by the owner’s daughter.

But this sentimental sketch wasn’t built to keep up with a growing brand. As Letka gained popularity on social media and started drawing both locals and tourists, its identity began to blur – especially with a competitor just a block away tapping into the same aviation theme.

~~On site, we discovered another layer of complexity: the adjoining theatre space—Club Letka—operated under the same ownership but with a distinctly different purpose. Two connected spaces with disconnected visual identities, both competing for recognition in Prague’s cultural landscape.~~

### ~~Finding Inspiration in the Skies~~  
### What If Letters Could Fly?

The design brief grew more complex on-site. Club Letka, a sister theatre venue under the same roof, had no visual connection to the café—despite shared ownership and clientele. The identities felt disconnected. We needed to unify them without losing their individual character.

~~I immersed myself in the café environment, observing how patrons moved through the space and how the atmosphere shifted from day to evening when the theatre crowd arrived.~~

~~While sketching with coffee in hand, I searched for something more abstract. After all, there must be a way to convey aviation heritage without explicitly emphasising an aeroplane.~~

So I observed. I sketched. I sipped (a lot). And I watched Letka shift – from slow, sleepy mornings to lively, laughter-filled nights.

~~Sitting at the airport, heading to London for a six-month stint to gain additional qualifications, inspiration struck: the essence of aviation didn’t have to be anchored in the aeroplanes themselves, but in the dynamic, unexpected paths they carved through the sky – regardless of make, shape, or size.~~

~~I proposed to my team:~~
> ~~_“What if the letters themselves followed these flight paths?”_~~

The breakthrough came not in the café, but at the airport—heading to London for a six-month study stint. Aviation, I realised, doesn’t just live in machines. It lives in **motion**. In the sky’s invisible patterns. And that’s when I pitched it:

> _"What if the typography could actually move – like tiny planes tracing paths through the sky?"_

## ~~Typography as the Hero~~ 
## How Typography Became Our Wingman

~~Typography became the core of our concept, and choosing the right typeface was crucial. Everyone on our team searched for something with character but not quirks, distinctive but legible when following invisible flight paths.~~

~~After extensive testing, we settled on Atyp BL in confident uppercase. The letterforms, when following our imaginary contrails, maintained their integrity while gaining dynamic qualities that static typography couldn’t achieve.~~

The team and I agreed: this concept had wings. The challenge? Finding a typeface that could hold its own mid-flight—something with enough presence to feel dynamic, but refined enough to retain legibility.

After rounds of testing, we landed on Atyp BL in bold uppercase. It moved, curved, and floated – always clear, never chaotic.

~~A disciplined black and white colour palette kept the focus on the typography’s movement without competing elements. For the club’s identity, we flipped this approach—vibrant colours filled the dark theatre space, parallel to the life within.~~

To amplify the type’s movement, we embraced a strict black-and-white palette for the café. Club Letka’s identity, by contrast, flipped the script: deep theatre shadows lit up with bursts of color and energy.

### ~~From Concept to Reality~~ 
### Design Takes Off: From Sketch to Signage

~~Our direction was clear, so it was time to put the concept on paper. This included coffee cups, menus, packaging, and signage for the café interior.~~

~~The contrails carried straightforward and easily digestible messages, mostly reiterating the item at hand (e.g., “menu - menu - menu”) or short slogans like “Už letím do Letky,” which translates to “I’m flying to Letka”—a phrase that sounds far more organic in Czech. We kept these messages short to ensure legibility and accessibility.~~

With the system defined, we moved into applications: cups, menus, bags, aprons, and signage. Every piece was built around our visual language of "flying type."

Short slogans like _“Už letím do Letky”_ (“I’m flying to Letka”) created rhythm and recognition. Contrails carried repeated type patterns – _“menu – menu – menu”_ – in playful loops. These weren’t just labels; they were motion-filled, accessible brand moments.

### ~~The Unexpected Landing~~ 
### The Client Pivot: A Softer Landing

~~The presentation to the client was met with initial enthusiasm. “It’s very well thought out,” the owner acknowledged, “but perhaps we’re looking for our identity to include more organic and free-hand, less structured elements.” Despite our conversations about how this system would effectively differentiate them from competitors, the client ultimately chose a simpler, more logo-centric approach.~~

The final presentation was met with warm praise – _“It’s very well thought out,”_ the owner said – but there was also a pause.

In the end, they chose a simpler, more logo-focused route. Not quite the landing we envisioned, but one that taught us plenty about letting go.

### ~~Learning from Every Flight Path~~ 
### Two Lessons from the Letka Flight Path

~~Though the project didn’t land where we hoped, the experience yielded two key insights:~~

~~Remote Collaboration: Managing rigorous work internationally improved my ability to develop meticulous documentation and communication practices that have strengthened all my subsequent projects.~~

~~Balancing Concept & Function: Creating a system that pushed boundaries while remaining functional taught me to better articulate the practical benefits of conceptual thinking.~~

~~Like the contrails that inspired this design system, the project itself left its mark on my approach—teaching me to find stories in unexpected places and see beyond the obvious in every design challenge.~~

Though the system didn’t take full flight, the journey shaped how I work:

1. **Remote collaboration sharpened my documentation.** With part of the work done while living abroad, I refined the way I communicate visuals and rationale—ensuring clarity, even across time zones.

2. **Balancing concept with function.** I learned how to sell not just ideas, but the _value_ behind them: how a design system solves problems, not just looks good.

Like the contrails it was built around, this project left a trace—proof that even grounded ideas can fuel future flights.
