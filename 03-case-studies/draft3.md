### ~~Coffee is always a great partner in crime, so unsurprisingly, I was excited to make my way to Café Letka~~ The Café with a Hand-Drawn Plane

Coffee is always a faithful sidekick—so when a café project lands on your desk, you know it’s going to be a good one. Café Letka sits near Prague’s military aviation museum, and above its entrance hangs a charming logo: a hand-drawn aeroplane created by the owner’s daughter. ~~While endearing, this simple emblem faced mounting challenges.~~

But this sentimental sketch wasn’t built to keep up with a growing brand. As Letka gained popularity on social media and started drawing both locals and tourists, its identity began to blur—especially with a competitor just a block away tapping into the same aviation theme.

## ~~Finding Inspiration in the Skies~~  What If Letters Could Fly?

The design brief grew more complex on-site. Club Letka, a sister theatre venue under the same roof, had no visual connection to the café—despite shared ownership and clientele. The identities felt disconnected. We needed to unify them without losing their individual character.

So I observed. I sipped, sketched, and watched the crowd transition from quiet mornings to buzzing evenings. ~~While sketching with coffee in hand, I searched for something more abstract.~~  

The breakthrough came not in the café, but at the airport—heading to London for a six-month study stint. Aviation, I realized, doesn’t just live in machines. It lives in **motion**. In the sky’s invisible patterns. And that’s when I pitched it:

> _"What if our typography flew—not just metaphorically, but quite literally across the layout?"_

## ~~Typography as the Hero~~ How Typography Became Our Wingman

The team and I agreed: this concept had wings. The challenge? Finding a typeface that could hold its own mid-flight—something with enough presence to feel dynamic, but refined enough to retain legibility.

After rounds of testing, we chose **Atyp BL** in uppercase. ~~The letterforms, when following our imaginary contrails, maintained their integrity while gaining dynamic qualities that static typography couldn’t achieve.~~ They moved, curved, and floated—without ever losing their clarity.

To amplify the type’s movement, we embraced a strict black-and-white palette for the café. Club Letka’s identity, by contrast, flipped the script: deep theatre shadows lit up with bursts of color and energy.

## ~~From Concept to Reality~~ Design Takes Off: From Sketch to Signage

With the system defined, we moved into applications: cups, menus, bags, aprons, and signage. Every piece was built around our visual language of "flying type."

Short slogans like _“Už letím do Letky”_ (“I’m flying to Letka”) created rhythm and recognition. Contrails carried repeated type patterns—_“menu – menu – menu”_—in playful loops. These weren’t just labels; they were motion-filled, accessible brand moments.

## ~~The Unexpected Landing~~ The Client Pivot: A Softer Landing

The final presentation was met with warm praise—_“It’s very well thought out,”_ the owner noted—but also hesitation. ~~“But perhaps we’re looking for our identity to include more organic and free-hand, less structured elements.”~~

Despite conversations about differentiation, the client ultimately went with a **simpler, logo-centered approach**. A softer landing than we’d planned, but a revealing one.

## ~~Learning from Every Flight Path~~ Two Lessons from the Letka Flight Path

Though the system didn’t take full flight, the journey shaped how I work:

1. **Remote collaboration sharpened my documentation.** With part of the work done while living abroad, I refined the way I communicate visuals and rationale—ensuring clarity, even across time zones.

2. **Balancing concept with function.** I learned how to sell not just ideas, but the _value_ behind them: how a design system solves problems, not just looks good.

~~Like the contrails that inspired this design system, the project itself left its mark on my approach—teaching me to find stories in unexpected places and see beyond the obvious in every design challenge.~~  
Like the contrails it was built around, this project left a trace—proof that even grounded ideas can fuel future flights.
